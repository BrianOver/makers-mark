/// THE PA3 PIN (plan 2026-07-21-002, PKD5): a Morning that never submits a counter action must
/// stay BYTE-IDENTICAL to the ATOMIC path of whatever kernel composition is current — the
/// atomic <c>HeroShoppingSystem</c> pass is still the default day loop. This is the FIRST test
/// PA3 lands (HIGH-RISK-land-tests-first): the expected hash below was originally captured
/// against the pre-PA3 <see cref="GameComposition.BuildKernel"/> (commit a7ae67d, before
/// <c>GameKernel.Advance</c>, <c>GameComposition</c>, or <c>HeroShoppingSystem</c> gained any
/// counter-awareness).
///
/// RE-BASELINED (Game-Feel Plan G3, 2026-07-21): this 30-day/zero-action script is now
/// necessarily idle every day by construction (ActionSlotsRemaining never drops, since no
/// slot-consuming action is ever submitted), so the NEW always-on <c>RentSystem</c> (rent comes
/// due at day 10/20/30) and <c>MarketShareSystem</c> (idling every day rides the rival's edge to
/// its 1000‰ cap, discounting <c>RivalRestockSystem</c>'s newly-minted stock) legitimately move
/// the serialized state — this is G3 working as designed, not a counter-additivity regression.
/// The hash below is the new baseline post-G3; the PA3 invariant it protects (atomic == the
/// current kernel's non-counter path) is otherwise unchanged. A future feature that touches
/// composed state on an all-empty-actions run will need the same deliberate re-baseline.
